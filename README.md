# ABReport
Small GUI for reporting incoming in AB for WoW Classic 1.13

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Q0x1zGF.png">

Click on the location once for each enemy you want to report, after 1.5 sec of no clicking it will print out the message to the chat.

To report safe location, click location first and then Safe button.

Cancel as you might have figured out cancels the message to be printed, incase of missclick.



TODO:

1. Fix keybindings, somehow they stopped working as soon as i made a GUI.
2. Command to reset location of frame
3. Config page

Future features if i get around to it:

1. Add WSG
